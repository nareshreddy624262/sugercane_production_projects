# Sugarcane Production Data Analysis

Welcome to the Sugarcane Production Data Analysis repository! This project focuses on analyzing sugarcane production data to provide insights into global production trends, yields, and more. The analysis includes various metrics such as production volumes, yields, and production percentages.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sugarcane production data across different countries and continents. The data includes several key metrics:

- **Country**: The country where the production is measured.
- **Continent**: The continent to which the country belongs.
- **Production (Tons)**: The total sugarcane production in tons.
- **Production per Person (Kg)**: The amount of sugarcane produced per person in kilograms.
- **Acreage (Hectare)**: The area of land used for sugarcane production in hectares.
- **Yield (Kg/Hectare)**: The yield of sugarcane per hectare in kilograms.
- **Production (Tons) Percentage**: The percentage contribution of each country's production to the total global production.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

- `Sugarcane_Production_Analysis.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code and visualizations.
- `data/` â€“ Folder with the raw data files used in the analysis (e.g., `sugarcane_production_data.csv`).
- `visualizations/` â€“ (Optional) Folder with generated charts and graphs.
- `README.md` â€“ This file providing an overview of the project.

## ðŸ”— Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sugarcane-production-data-analysis.git

##  Data Description
  The dataset contains the following columns:
  - Country: The specific country where the data was collected.
  - Continent: Continent classification for the country.
  -  Production (Tons): Total production of sugarcane in tons.
  -  Production per Person (Kg): Amount of production per person in kilograms.
  -  acreage (Hectare): Total land area used for sugarcane cultivation.
  -  yield (Kg/Hectare): The efficiency of sugarcane production per hectare.
  -  production (Tons) Percentage: Relative production percentage compared to global totals.

## Features

   - Global Analysis: Overview of sugarcane production trends across different continents.
   - Country-Level Insights: Detailed analysis of sugarcane production metrics by country.
  - Yield Comparisons: Comparison of sugarcane yield across various regions.
  -Interactive Visualizations: Engaging charts and graphs to explore the data interactively.
